                            <h2>League of legends</h2>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/cabin.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview:</span> League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games and released in 2009, has become one of the most influential titles in the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre. With its combination of strategic depth, competitive gameplay, and a rich lore, it has captured the hearts of millions of players worldwide.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay:</span> At its core, League of Legends is a team-based game where two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, located in their base. Players choose from a diverse roster of over 150 champions, each with unique abilities and playstyles. The game features three main lanes (top, mid, and bot) and a jungle area, encouraging a mix of strategic planning, teamwork, and individual skill.
                                The gameplay is fast-paced and requires quick decision-making, with matches typically lasting between 20 to 50 minutes. Players must effectively manage resources, build their champions with items, and coordinate with teammates to secure objectives like towers, dragons, and Baron Nashor.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics and Design:</span> League of Legends boasts a vibrant art style that is both colorful and detailed. The character designs are imaginative, with each champion having their own unique visual flair. The maps are well-designed, providing a balanced playing field with various strategic points. The user interface is intuitive, making it relatively easy for new players to learn, although mastering the game can take time.
                                <br><br>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/cake.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br>
                                Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play 6v6 hero shooter by NetEase Games, combining fast-paced gameplay with the rich lore of the Marvel Universe. Featuring 35 playable characters, it offers a mix of heroes and villains, each with unique abilities and roles (Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist). Its approach to free-to-play mechanics—no pay-to-win elements and no expiring battle passes—has earned it praise for fairness. Since launch, it has attracted millions of players and continues to grow in popularity.
                               <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay</span><br>
                                Marvel Rivals excels in gameplay variety. The three roles—Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist—allow for numerous team compositions, appealing to different playstyles. Combat is fluid and engaging, with each hero offering a distinct skill set. The 6v6 format emphasizes team coordination, where strategies can make or break a match. That said, balancing is a sticking point. Certain heroes are noticeably overpowered, leading to repetitive matchups and frustration in competitive modes. Additionally, while the maps are well-designed in theory, their visual clutter can hinder tactical gameplay. With future patches, these issues could be addressed to enhance the overall experience.

                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics and Art Style</span><br>

The characters are meticulously designed, capturing the essence of Marvel heroes and villains. Special effects, like Spider-Man’s webs or Doctor Strange’s spells, are vibrant and immersive, adding flair to the action. However, some players have noted that certain environments feel cluttered, making it hard to read the battlefield during intense fights. Overall, it’s a visual treat, particularly for fans who appreciate attention to detail in character designs.
                                <br><br>

NetEase has supported this with regular updates, events, and seasonal content. Competitive tournaments and themed events tied to Marvel lore keep the player base engaged. However, some newcomers have voiced concerns about the steep learning curve and a lack of detailed onboarding for new players, which can alienate casual gamers. Despite this, the overall vibe within the community is positive, bolstered by active forums and fan groups.
                                <br><br>

                            <h2>Genshin impact</h2>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/circus.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview:</span> Genshin Impact, developed by miHoYo (now known as HoYoverse), is an open-world action RPG that burst onto the gaming scene in September 2020. It quickly garnered widespread acclaim for its stunning visuals, expansive world, and engaging gameplay mechanics. Set in the fantasy realm of Teyvat, players take on the role of the Traveler, a mysterious figure searching for their lost sibling while unraveling the secrets of this vibrant world.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics and Art Style:</span> One of Genshin Impact's standout features is its breathtaking art style, which draws inspiration from anime aesthetics. The vibrant colors, intricate character designs, and beautifully crafted environments create an immersive experience. Each region within Teyvat has its unique visual identity, from the lush landscapes of Mondstadt to the serene beauty of Liyue and the more recent additions like Inazuma and Sumeru. The attention to detail is remarkable, making exploration a joy.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay:</span> Genshin Impact combines action RPG elements with gacha mechanics, allowing players to collect and upgrade characters. Combat is fast-paced and fluid, relying on a combination of elemental abilities and character switching to create powerful combos. The elemental system is one of the game's highlights, encouraging players to experiment with different character combinations and strategies.
                                Exploration is a core aspect of gameplay, with a sprawling open world filled with secrets, puzzles, and treasures. Climbing, gliding, and swimming mechanics add depth to the exploration, while the game's various challenges, including domains and bosses, provide engaging content for players seeking to test their skills.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Story and Characters:</span> The narrative in Genshin Impact is delivered through quests and character interactions, with a rich lore that unfolds as players progress. Each character has a unique backstory and personality, contributing to the game's overall charm. The character development is well-executed, with many characters receiving their own story quests that delve deeper into their motivations and relationships.
                                However, some players feel that the main storyline can be slow-paced at times, especially with the frequent drip-feed of new content. The game has continued to expand its lore with each new region, but the overarching narrative may not always keep players engaged.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gacha Mechanics:</span> Genshin Impact employs a gacha system for acquiring new characters and weapons, which can be a double-edged sword. While the thrill of pulling for rare characters can be exhilarating, it also poses a risk for players who may feel pressured to spend real money. The game does offer a variety of free-to-play options, and players can earn in-game currency through gameplay, but the balance between enjoyment and spending can be a concern for some.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Community and Events:</span> The Genshin Impact community is vibrant and active, with numerous fan creations, guides, and discussions. HoYoverse regularly hosts events and updates, introducing new characters, storylines, and gameplay features. These events often keep the player base engaged and provide opportunities for cooperative play.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</span> Genshin Impact is a remarkable achievement in the realm of free-to-play gaming, successfully blending stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a rich world to explore. While its gacha mechanics can be contentious, the game’s overall execution offers a fulfilling experience for both casual players and dedicated fans. With continuous updates and new content, Genshin Impact has solidified its place as a staple in modern gaming, appealing to a wide audience and maintaining a loyal player base.</p>

                            <h2>World of warcraft</h2>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/safe.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>"World of Warcraft" (WoW), developed by Blizzard Entertainment, is one of the most influential and enduring MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) since its launch in 2004. The game has undergone numerous expansions, content updates, and changes, making it a constantly evolving experience. Here’s a review that encompasses various aspects of the game:
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameplay</span><br>
                                WoW offers a rich and immersive gameplay experience. Players create characters from various races and classes, each with unique abilities and lore. The game world of Azeroth is vast, filled with quests, dungeons, and raids that encourage exploration and teamwork. The questing system is engaging, with a mix of combat, exploration, and narrative-driven tasks. The leveling curve provides a sense of progression, and the endgame content, including raids and PvP, offers challenges that cater to different player preferences.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Story and Lore</span><br>
                                The lore of WoW is one of its standout features. With a deep narrative that spans multiple expansions, players encounter a wide array of characters, factions, and historical events. Blizzard has effectively built a rich universe, with engaging storytelling that captivates both new players and veterans. The expansions often introduce new story arcs that expand on existing lore, keeping the narrative fresh.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics and Art Style</span><br>
                                While WoW's graphics have evolved over the years, its distinctive art style remains a highlight. The cartoony aesthetic allows for a vibrant and colorful world that feels alive, even if it doesn’t match the realism of some modern titles. The environments are diverse, from lush forests and snowy mountains to desolate wastelands, each meticulously designed to create an immersive atmosphere.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Community and Social Aspects</span><br>
                                The community is a significant aspect of WoW. Players can join guilds, participate in group activities, and engage in social interactions that enhance the gameplay experience. The game has a reputation for fostering strong friendships and communities, although it can also have its share of toxicity, as seen in many online games.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accessibility</span><br>
                                WoW has made strides in accessibility, allowing new players to jump in with relative ease. The introduction of features like the "new player experience" and streamlined leveling has made the game more welcoming. However, the sheer volume of content can be overwhelming for newcomers, and the complexity of certain systems may require a learning curve.
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monetization</span><br>
                                The game's subscription model has been a point of contention. While many players appreciate the lack of pay-to-win mechanics, others feel that the ongoing subscription fee can be a barrier, especially with the introduction of microtransactions for cosmetics and services.
